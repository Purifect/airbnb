To count the number of instances greater than a value using numpy, you can use broadcasting, which is a special way of indexing into a numpy array. For example, the code `some_array>5` will return a new numpy array of true/false elements. It is the same size as `some_array` and is marked true where the array is greater than `5`, and false otherwise. By taking the `sum` of this array, we can count how many times `some_array` is greater than `5`. \n",

    "If the samples are weighted, it will be easier to optimize the tree structure using weight-based pre-pruning criterion such as min_weight_fraction_leaf, which ensure that leaf nodes contain at least a fraction of the overall sum of the sample weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_weight_fraction_leaf**, default=0.0: The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.\n",
    "- **min_samples_leaf**, default=1: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n",
    "- **max_depthint**, default=None: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples."

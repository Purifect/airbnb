    "<p><b>Who</b>:      Airbnb is an online market place that connects people. It acts as an intermediary between those who wish to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. In that way Airbnb does not does not own any properties. Airbnb makes money by charging a service fee. The service fee is a percentage of the total bill to both guests and hosts. Hosts are responsible for the management of the property. They must buy or rent the property, coordinate with guests, and clean up after them. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Where</b>:        The data comes from <a>http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2021-08-04/data/listings.csv.gz</a>. This website was funded by Murray Cox. The site is not associated with or endorsed by Airbnb or their competitors. The data utilizes public information compiled from the Airbnb website. Listings on Airbnb can be deleted from the platoform. The data presented by Inside Airbnb represents a snapshot at a particular time, August 4, 2021 </b> Our particular focus is on NYC, New York.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>What</b>:         We want to use this data to predict the following:<br>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "    <ol> \n",
    "        1. <b>Superhost</b> <br>\n",
    "        <br />\n",
    "        - With the data we will predict Superhost status. This is a classification problem. <br>\n",
    "        <br />\n",
    "        - In order to measure the effectiveness of our model we will accuracy as our metric.<br>\n",
    "        <br />\n",
    "        2. <b>Price</b> <br>\n",
    "        <br />\n",
    "            - With the same data set will predict price of a listing. This is a regression problem. <br>\n",
    "        <br />\n",
    "            - In order to measure the effectiveness of our model we will use Root Mean Squared error (RMSE).\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Why:</b>       Why is our analysis important. The superhost badge is a big deal to people who host on Airbnb. It means greater visibilty and increase in trust with prospective guests. This adds up to loss of potential earnings if denied access. Is Airbnb consistent with their superhost rating? Airbnb publish guidlines for becoming a superhost. Are they consistent when it comes to applying these rules or is the some bias towards certain types of hosts?<br> Hosts set their own price. There is an incentive to maximize price. But what factors are most important? Setting the correct price to the market allows hosts to reach the full capitalization potential of their listing. </p>"
